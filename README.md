# Getting Started 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

First run: 

### `npm install`

Then, run the app with:
 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In a second terminal, run (don't close the first terminal):

### `npm run server`

Runs a fake data base to test the app.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
This will create a file call db.json (if the file not exist already).

Once you complete the form and submit the form, the file db.json will automatically update, showing the json object.
